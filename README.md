# 🌌 Hey, I’m **Yash** — building myself like an anime protagonist

*Just a 9th grader grinding like my life is a shōnen arc.*  
Balancing **IIT JEE prep**, **gym**, and **YouTube** while aiming for **MIT → Google → Japan**.  
Every day, I push to become the “dangerous version” of myself — Obito style.

## 🚀 What I’m Currently Leveling Up In  
- 📚 **Maths, Physics, Chemistry** (preparing early for IIT JEE)  
- 💻 **DSA, Python, AI basics**  
- ✍️ **YouTube content**: anime × self-improvement (Konoha Skool)  
- 🧠 **Mindset training** inspired by Ayanokoji, Toji, Obito  
- 🇯🇵 **Japanese** (for my Tokyo dreams)  
- 🏋️‍♂️ **Physique grinding** — chasing that *Toji Fushiguro × Prem Joshi* hybrid build

## 🎬 My YouTube Project – *Konoha Skool*  
I turn anime psychology into real-life power-ups.  
Long-form, faceless videos.  
Study motivation. Habit systems. Life discipline.  
If Ayanokoji had a channel for students — it’d feel like this.
